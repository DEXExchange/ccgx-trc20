# Crypto Cannabis Game

A decentralized strategy game that involves growing, p2p trading and breeding herbal collectibles to create high value non-fungible cannabis strains (like that rare Crypto Kitty NFT you own)

CCGX is the in-game token that allows you to develop strains with unique attributes which reflect real-world medicinal and recreational qualities.

CCGX is your gateway to owning licensed dispensaries, winning prizes in annual Crypto Cannabis Cups (think Triwizard tournaments) and bidding for strains in auction houses.

CCGX will evolve into being the transfer of value in a global marketplace of consumer-goods related to cannabis.

With distributed ledger technology, CCGX will provide cryptocurrency settlement options to e-commerce and brick & mortar cannabis stores.

CCGX will expand its centralized and decentralized exchange listings for easy access to Bitcoin and Stablecoin liquidity.

CCGX holders will receive dividends from in-game revenues at the end of each quarter for freezing their CCGX in a custodial contract.

The periodic payout is directly proportionate to the amount of tokens frozen in the aforementioned escrow.
